# Python-Simples-Registration-System

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

One of my first mini-projects with the first programming language I started to learn.

I created a simple program that allows you to register a person with their name and age. There is the possibility to display the list of registered people.

One of the goals was to create error and exception handling, import functions created from the other files and the creation of a txt file if it does not already exist automatically.
